Netflix Data Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the Netflix dataset to uncover trends in content distribution, genre popularity, release timelines, and regional contributions. Using Python and libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the data was cleaned and explored to gain meaningful insights. The analysis reveals that Netflix's content is predominantly movies, with genres like Drama and Comedy being most common. A significant increase in content additions has been observed since 2016, with the USA, India, and the UK being the top contributors. This project highlights how data analytics can provide a deeper understanding of content strategy and audience targeting on digital platforms.
